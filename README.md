# Adnat Challenge - React Implementation
This repo contains my code to the Adnat React challenge which tasks the creation of a front-end solution of a simplified version of Tanda's web app.

As this is a front-end solution, all the code in the ``` /backend ``` folder was pre-written. The backend code functions as a JSON REST API.

This project was created using React along with multiple popular node modules from the npm registry, such as react-bootstrap, lodash, and axios.


## Installation and Setup
To install the backend, navigate to the root of this repository and run

```
yarn backend:setup
```

To start the server:

```
yarn backend:start
```

Similar commands are performed for the front-end. To install:

```
yarn frontend:setup
```

To start running the solution on port 8080:

```
yarn frontend:start
```

Open up ```localhost:8080``` to begin using the program.

## Usage
The app is intended to be used how the specs determined it. Users can create accounts, log in, join and edit organisation details, and create shifts within their organisation. An additional feature of editing users was created.

## Limitations and Points of Improvement
